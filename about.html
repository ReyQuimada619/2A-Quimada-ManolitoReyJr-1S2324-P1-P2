<p><font face = "Arial" color = "white"><b>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language</b>, is the standard language for creating web pages and web applications. Here's some information about HTML and its history:
<br><br>
<b>HTML</b> was first introduced by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist, in 1991. He created it as a markup language to format and link documents on the World Wide Web. The initial version was known as HTML 1.0.
<br><br>
Over the years, HTML has undergone several revisions and updates to introduce new features, improve compatibility, and enhance functionality. Some key milestones include HTML 2.0 (1995), HTML 3.2 (1997), HTML 4.0 (1999), and XHTML 1.0 (2000).
<br><br>
<b>HTML</b> 4.0 was a significant advancement, introducing features like tables, forms, and style sheets. It provided a foundation for web development during the late 1990s and early 2000s.
<br><br>
<b>XHTML</b> (eXtensible HyperText Markup Language) 1.0, introduced in 2000, was an XML-based version of HTML. It aimed to provide stricter syntax rules and compatibility with XML tools. However, XHTML adoption faced challenges, and it gradually gave way to HTML5.
<br><br>
<b>HTML5</b>, officially standardized in 2014, represents a major evolution of the language. It introduced numerous new elements and attributes, as well as native support for multimedia, forms, and APIs. HTML5 also focused on improving the handling of rich media content, making it more efficient and accessible.
<br><br>
Today,<b> HTML5 </b>is the dominant version of HTML and forms the basis for modern web development. It is supported by all major web browsers and serves as the foundation for building interactive, dynamic, and visually appealing websites and web applications.
